    ## Stock AI Recommendations for week of {week_str}

    ### Methodology:
    1. Scrape recent posts from r/wallstreetbets with flairs: News, DD, YOLO.
    2. Filter posts by upvotes and engagement to retain high-quality content.
    3. Use AI agents to analyze posts by flair:
       - News Agent: Extracts stock mentions and sentiment from news posts.
       - DD Agent: Provides high-conviction buy ideas from due diligence posts.
       - YOLO Agent: Identifies speculative, high-risk/reward ideas from YOLO posts.
    4. Merge and deduplicate recommendations from all agents.
    5. Fetch latest stock data and technical indicators for recommended tickers.
    6. Use a Portfolio Planner Agent to create trading plans with entry, stop, targets, and risk/reward.
    7. Compile final recommendations with analysis, snapshot, and trading strategy.

    - R/R: The risk-to-reward ratio of the trade (e.g., 1.5 means potential reward is 1.5Ã— the risk).
